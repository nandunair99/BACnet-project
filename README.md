Developed a Utility Library from scratch for a device driver, enabling remote connectivity and operation of a Samsung BACnet Gateway. This enhancement led to a 20% reduction in on-site maintenance visits and a corresponding decrease in operational costs.

• Designed a dynamic system for adding and removing value change
listeners for all parameters. This feature streamlined monitoring and
facilitated prompt responses to parameter changes.

• Tech Stack: BACnet4j wrapper library for communicating to the
device using BACnet protocol and Quartz Job Scheduler for
scheduling listeners with Java 8.
